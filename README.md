# python-rss

Inspired by (and mostly copied from https://github.com/djdefi/rss-firehose), this is a simple python script to retrieve the last 100 posts on r/Olympia that are no older than 7 days and deploy them to GitHub Pages. eg: https://tblanarik.github.io/python-rss/

It runs every Friday at 16:00, to keep my Reddit consumption to once a week and only on select subreddits.
